            Hajimemashite!  Nice to meet you.  My name is Matt Tedder, and I assume you are reading this to get some insight into who I
            am.  I'm just like you, drifting through life pretending to know what I am doing.  While experiencing this thing called life, I was
            presented the opportunity to live in Japan for a few years.  This was a blessing that took everything I thought I knew about life and
            turned it upside down.  I am so grateful for this because it allowed me to be a more understanding, open-minded, and empathetic person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now thirty years old, I am ready to stop pretending I enjoy where I work and pursue something I have always been fascinated with since
            a young age: technology!  Hurling into existence in 1987, I am in a unique space to know what it was like before we were hit by the Internet, yet still
            young enough to fully embrace/appreciate it.  Even today I still have to stop and marvel at what we humans have been able to create with our brains.
            Well, I guess that is all on me for now, thanks for reading!
