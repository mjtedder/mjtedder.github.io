            <img src="assets\images\profile picture.jpg" alt="Matt Tedder" id="bio-image" width="200" height="200"> Hajimemashite! Nice to meet you. My name is Matt Tedder, and I assume you are reading this to get some insight into who I am. I'm just
            like you, drifting through life trying to figure everything out. While experiencing this thing called life, I was presented the opportunity to live in Japan for a few years. This was a blessing that took everything I thought I knew about life
            and turned it upside down. I am so grateful for this because it allowed me to be a more understanding, open-minded, and empathetic person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now thirty years old, I am ready to stop pretending I enjoy where I work and pursue something I have always been fascinated with since a young age: technology! Hurling into existence in 1987, I am in a unique space to know what it was like before we were
            hit by the Internet, yet still young enough to fully embrace/appreciate it. Even today I still have to stop and marvel at what we humans have been able to create with our brains. Well, I guess that is all on me for now, thanks for reading!
